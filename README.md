# MLF-SC: Incorporating Multi-Layer Features to Sparse Coding for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
====

MLF-SC (Multi-Layer Feature Sparse Coding) is an anomaly detection method that incoporates multipscale features to sparse coding.
This is a PyTorch implementation of MLF-SC for [MVTec texture dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/).
